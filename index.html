  LogoLyze is a software to display an analyze graphs of all kind that are 
  available in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP">OLAP database</a>. 
  LogoLyze is optimized for maximum flexiblity, 
  regarding analyzation capabilities as well as the possibility to use the 
  software with differently structured databases.<br /><br />

  Graph OLAP has been handled in theory by several scientists 
  <a href="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj/pdf/icdm08_cchen.pdf">in a paper</a>. 
  According to our research, there has not been an easy to use, production ready
  software to visualize this data. <br /><br />

  The software has been developed in a practical course at the 
  <a href="http://www.kit.edu/">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a>
  by Timo Paulssen, Florian Larysch, Andreas Fried, Uwe L. Korn and me. 
  The project was motivated by the research project
