LogoLyze is a software to display an analyze graphs of all kind that are 
available in an [OLAP database](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP)
LogoLyze is optimized for maximum flexiblity, regarding analyzation 
capabilities as well as the possibility to use the
software with differently structured databases.
                                                                                                                                                               
Graph OLAP has been handled in theory by several scientists 
[in a paper](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~hanj/pdf/icdm08_cchen.pdf).
According to our research, there has not been an easy to use, production ready
software to visualize this data.
                                                                                                                                                               
The software has been developed in a practical course at the
[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](http://www.kit.edu/)
by Timo Paulssen, Florian Larysch, Andreas Fried, Uwe L. Korn and Lukas Barth.
The project was motivated by the research project [Logotakt](http://www.logotakt.de/).
