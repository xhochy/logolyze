Basic usage
===========
1. Connect to a database
2. Select a cube using the drop-down list in the upper left
   corner.
3. Click on the axes to configure them.
   In case of t-Dimensions, the Level-list is unavailable,
   select the desired levels in the values box.
4. You may need to select a t-Dimension from the hierarchy tree
   on the left if you have not done so on the axes yet.

Using the GUI
=============
You can zoom into and move the graphs by using your scrollwheel
or dragging, respectively.
While holding shift you can move single nodes around or select
groups of nodes to move.
You can also export a graph or display it in a new window by
right-clicking on it.

Measures
========
Available measures can be displayed in the graphs. To select
which measures to display and how to display them, open the
measure configuration dialog by clicking on the symbol in the
lower left corner of the graph pane.

Saving and restoring state
==========================
You can save and restore your current GUI perspective using
File->Load/Save Perspective.
Note: This does *not* include the database connection!
